# PromptCraft-Robotics

The PromptCraft-Robotics repository serves as community for people to share interesting prompting examples for large language models (LLMs) within the robotics domain.
We focus on LLMs with open APIs (for example OpenAI models such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), [GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/) and Codex), but we also welcome examples from other LLMs (for example open-sourced models).

Users can contribute to this repository by submitting interesting prompt examples to the [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions) section of this repository. A prompt can be submitted within different robotics categories such as [Manipulation](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-manipulation), [Home Robotics](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-home-robots), [Physical Reasoning](https://github.com/microsoft/PromptCraft-Robotics/discussions/categories/llm-physical-reasoning), among many others.
Once submitted, the prompt will be reviewed by the community (upvote your favorites!) and added to the repository by a team of admins if it is deemed interesting and useful.
We encourage users to submit prompts that are interesting, fun, or useful. We also encourage users to submit prompts that are not necessarily "correct" or "optimal" but are interesting nonetheless.

We encourage prompt submissions in terms of an HTML conversation. You can use this reposotory to export your ChatGPT chat for example: [ADD MORE INTRUCTIONS HERE]
